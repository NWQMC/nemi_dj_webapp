The objective of sorting is to find as many distinct taxa as practical within the 2-hour limit.

Sorting is focused on mature, undamaged organisms that can produce Genus- or Species-level taxonomic resolution.  Immature or damaged specimens are sorted if it is likely that they represent new taxa from the sample.  The objective of sorting is to find as many distinct taxa as practical within the 2-hour limit.  Studies performed in the BG indicated that the rate of accrual of new taxa diminishes substantially after 2 hours of visiual sorting; therefore, the visual sorting period used in the qualitative method is limited to 2 hours.",
